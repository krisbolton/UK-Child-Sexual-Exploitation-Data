# UK Child Sexual Exploitation Data
Data from UK Government Departments, Agencies, Councils, Local and Unitary Authorities, Parliamentary Committees and Public Bodies relating to Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE). 

This data was collected under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 / 2002 (Scotland) and is thus free to use.

## Rationale

It is was my belief that various Government Departments, Agencies, Councils, Authorities and Public Bodies _don't_ gather appropraite statistics relating to Child Sexual Exploitation. A modern Government relies on statistics heavily to decide where to spend money, create projects, mitigate harm, etc. Without gathering data how can you know there's a problem? You simply can't.

My initial assumption has been proven correct according to data gathered so far. Government Departments who are responsible for child protection do _not_ gather appropraite data on the subject. __Thus, they have no way to know the extent of the problem or where to target resources.__

## Key Findings

+ The Ministry of Justice holds some of the data requested<sup>[1]</sup>.
+ The Office of National Statistics (ONS) holds _no specific data_ on Child Sexual Exploitation<sup>[2]</sup>.
+ The Home Office hold _no specific  data_ on Child Sexual Exploitation<sup>[3]</sup>. 
+ The Department of Health holds _no specific data_ on Child Sexual Exploitation<sup>[4]</sup>.
+ The Department of Comminities and Local Government holds _no data_ on Child Sexual Exploitation<sup>[5]</sup>.

The two most surprising findings from Government Departments and Public Bodies were the Home Office and Office of National Statistics (ONS) gather and hold no data specific to Child Sexual Exploitation. ONS does gather statistics which may relate to CSE, however. 

_Data was requested in Summer 2016._

## The Use of GitHub

GitHub is designed for software version control. Apart from its distributed nature allowing collaberation and redundancy, a main feature is the ability to log and view changes between additions (commits) and attribute them to a user. As a result GitHub, and other public distributed version control repositories are ideal for creating and storing datasets such as this one. Users can view every change from the projects creation. Commented and used well by the creator, the reason for each change is recorded.

Additionally, the use of GPG Keys can confirm the ID of the user committing changes to a repository.
