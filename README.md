# UK Child Sexual Exploitation Data
Data from UK Government Departments, Agencies, Councils, Local and Unitary Authorities, Parliamentary Committees and Public Bodies relating to Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE). 

## Rationale

It is was my belief that various Government Departments, Agencies, Councils, Authorities and Public Bodies _don't_ gather appropraite statistics relating to Child Sexual Exploitation. A modern Government relies on statistics heavily to decide where to spend money, create projects, mitigate harm, etc. Without gathering data how can you know there's a problem? You simply can't.

My initial assumption has been proven correct according to data gathered so far. Government Departments who are responsible for child protection do _not_ gather appropraite data on the subject. __Thus, they have no way to know the extent of the problem or where to target resources.__
