# UK Child Sexual Exploitation Data
Data from UK Government Departments, Agencies, Councils, Local and Unitary Authorities, Parliamentary Committees and Public Bodies relating to Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE). 

## Rationale

It is was my belief that various Government Departments, Agencies, Councils, Authorities and Public Bodies _don't_ gather appropraite statistics relating to Child Sexual Exploitation. A modern Government relies on statistics heavily to decide where to spend money, create projects, mitigate harm, etc. Without gathering data how can you know there's a problem? You simply can't.

My initial assumption has been proven correct according to data gathered so far. Government Departments who are responsible for child protection do _not_ gather appropraite data on the subject. __Thus, they have no way to know the extent of the problem or where to target resources.__

## Key Findings

+ The Ministry of Justice holds some of the data requested<sup>[1]</sup>.
+ The Office of National Statistics (ONS) holds _no data_ on Child Sexual Exploitation<sup>[2]</sup>.
+ The Home Office hold _no data_ on Child Sexual Exploitation<sup>[3]</sup>. 
+ The Department of Health holds _no data_ on Child Sexual Exploitation<sup>[4]</sup>.
+ The Department of Comminities and Local Government holds _no data_ on Child Sexual Exploitation<sup>[5]</sup>.
+ The National Crime Agency (NCA) is exempt from all Freedom of Information Requests.

The three most surprising findings from Government departments were the Home Office and Office of National Statistics gather and hold no data on CSE. Additionally, the fact the NCA is exempt from all FOIs is particularly odd.
