__Comments__

The wording of this request may have been too specific. The ONS stated they don't _hold_ data on CSE, however, as the national statistics service they did/do collect data relating to CSE - which they didn't state directly. They directed me to the Department of Education's statistics on 'Children in Need' (a broader, non-exploitation specific category) which they as the ONS collected on behalf of the DoE.
